Available at https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/35, it challenges participants to produce the best possible model for classifying products based on a photo and text. Rakuten is a Japanese online shopping platform, offering a wide range of products from electronics to clothing. Rakuten has several million products in its catalogue, making the cataloguing and sorting of these products a crucial issue for the company. The aim is to develop a multimodal classifier capable of classifying a product based on its thumbnail and a text description.",
